        "* Clipping: This technique involves limiting the amplitude of a waveform by \"clipping\" or \"chopping off\" the peaks of the waveform that exceed a certain threshold. This results in distortion as the clipped peaks are flattened, creating harmonics and altering the waveform's shape.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Soft Clipping: Soft clipping is a variation of clipping that involves gradually rounding off the peaks of a waveform as they approach the threshold, instead of abruptly clipping them. This creates a smoother distortion compared to hard clipping and can result in a more pleasing and musical distortion.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Overdrive: Overdrive is a form of distortion that emulates the behavior of overdriving an analog circuit, such as a tube amplifier. It involves applying a gain boost to the waveform that causes it to \"break up\" and create harmonics, resulting in a warm and rich distortion sound.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Wavefolding: Wavefolding is a technique that involves folding or bending the waveform back on itself when it exceeds a certain threshold. This results in the creation of new harmonics and complex waveforms, which can produce unique and interesting distortion effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Bitcrushing: Bitcrushing is a technique that involves reducing the bit depth of a digital waveform, effectively reducing its resolution. This results in a \"bit-reduced\" or \"lo-fi\" sound with quantization noise, which can create a harsh and gritty distortion effect.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Ring Modulation: Ring modulation is a technique that involves multiplying the input waveform with a modulating waveform to create sum and difference frequencies. This can result in a metallic or bell-like distortion effect with rich harmonics.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Feedback: Feedback is a technique that involves routing a portion of the output signal back into the input, causing the signal to be amplified and fed back on itself. This can result in self-oscillation and chaotic distortion effects.\n",
